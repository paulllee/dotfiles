# dotfiles

This bootstrap script pretty much installs and configures everything I need on macOS.

```sh
/usr/bin/env bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulllee/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

Restart your terminal after the script completes.

## dotsync

I provided an app to one-way sync from remote to your local dotfiles via `ds -d`.
View `ds -h` for more information.

## theme

My favorite theme is catppuccin mocha. It is used everywhere that it can.
