# dotfiles

Everything needed to setup my macOS.

1.  Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh).
2.  Clone this repo to `$HOME/.dotfiles`.
3.  Run `/usr/bin/env bash $HOME/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh`.
4.  Restart your terminal after the script completes.

That's it, you're all set from here!

## dotsync

I provided an app to one-way sync from remote to your local dotfiles via `ds -d`.
View `ds -h` for more information.
