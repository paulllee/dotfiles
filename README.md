# dotfiles

This bootstrap script pretty much installs and configures everything I need.

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulllee/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

## dotsync

I provided an app to one-way sync from remote to your local dotfiles via `ds -d`. 
View `ds -h` for more information.
